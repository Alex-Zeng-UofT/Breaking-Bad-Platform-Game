# Breaking Bad Platform Game 🧪🎮

> **CSCB58H3** Computer Architecture &nbsp; | &nbsp; Winter 2023 &nbsp; | &nbsp; **Project Grade:** &nbsp; 100%

🎶 **inserts Breaking Bad theme** 🎶

A low-level Assembly game simulated in a MIPS 32-Bit environment. Heisenberg is trying to deliver meth to Gus Fring while dodging the feds and avoiding obstacles on his way. He has 3 lives, hitting a rock loses a life, and coming in contact or being shot by the police is an instant GAME OVER. A cool effect would be hitting a rock, Heisenberg lights up in red while the rock disintegrates, done by adapting a Flood-Fill effect using recursion, in ASSEMBLY!
